# apiproject
An API explorer used with the SWAPI universe!

## Required Software
- Python 3.6.1
- json 3.6.1
- requests 2.13.0

## Procedure
This program loads in all of the Star Wars films from swapi.co and presents the user with the option to select a film. From inside of a selected film, the user can choose to explore the characters, vehicles, planets, starships, and attributes of the film. There are three layers of while loops in this program, so the user can choose to go back and forth between loops rather than having to restart the entire program to choose a different item within a single level of a film.
